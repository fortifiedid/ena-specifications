# Ena OAuth 2.0 Interoperability Profile

### Version: 1.0 - draft 01 - 2025-05-05

## Abstract

The OAuth 2.0 framework defines mechanisms that allow users (resource owners) to delegate access rights to a protected resource for an application they are using. Additionally, OAuth 2.0 protocols are often used without user involvement in service-to-service scenarios.

Over the years, numerous extensions and features have been introduced, making “OAuth 2.0” an insufficient label to guarantee interoperability between parties. Therefore, this document defines a profile for OAuth 2.0 to enhance interoperability, strengthen security, and enable more efficient and cost-effective deployments. While the profile is primarily intended for Swedish public and private services and organizations, it is not limited to them.

## 1. Introduction

This document defines a profile for the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework, establishing a baseline for interoperability and security for Swedish services.

It does not specify any sector-specific extensions or profile existing OAuth 2.0 extensions, except where required by this profile. However, such extensions may be defined in separate profiles that reference this document.

<a name="requirements-notation-and-conventions"></a>
### 1.1. Requirements Notation and Conventions

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” are to be interpreted as described in \[[RFC2119](#rfc2119)\].

These keywords are capitalized when used to unambiguously specify requirements over protocol features and behavior that affect the interoperability and security of implementations. When these words are not capitalized, they are meant in their natural-language sense.

<a name="terminology"></a>
### 1.2. Terminology

The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, \[[RFC6749](#rfc6749)\], defines the following roles:

- Resource Owner (RO) – An entity that grants access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a physical person, the terms End User or simply User may be used. In this document, we sometimes use the abbreviation "RO".

- Resource Server (RS) - A server hosting protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens. In this document, we sometimes use the abbreviation "RS".

- Client - An application that makes requests to protected resources on behalf of a resource owner (user) with proper authorization. In some documentation concerning OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, a client is sometimes referred to as a Relying Party.

- Authorization Server (AS) - A server responsible for issuing access tokens to a client after the resource owner (user) has been successfully authenticated and has granted the necessary authorization rights. In this document, we sometimes use the abbreviation "AS".

The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage, \[[RFC6750](#rfc6750)\], defines:

- Protected Resource (PR) - A resource (for example, an HTTP service), which is protected by OAuth 2.0 and requires a valid access token for access. In this document, we sometimes use the abbreviation "PR".

Clarification on the distinction between a Resource Server and a Protected Resource:

Some of the early OAuth 2.0 specifications used only the term Resource Server to denote the entity to which access is delegated. More recent specifications use the term Protected Resource, which is a more accurate and appropriate designation. This profile adopts the term Protected Resource when referring to the resource being protected and its access rules, and reserves the term Resource Server specifically for the server that hosts the Protected Resource, and is capable of accepting and processing access tokens.

<a name="conformance"></a>
### 1.3. Conformance

The profile document defines requirements for OAuth 2.0 protected resources, authorization servers, and clients.

When an entity compliant with this profile interacts with other entities that also conform to this profile, in any valid combination, all entities MUST fully adhere to the features and requirements of this specification. Interactions with non-compliant entities are outside the scope of this specification.

<a name="limitations-and-exclusions"></a>
### 1.4. Limitations and Exclusions

* An OAuth 2.0 public client is a client application that cannot securely store credentials, such as a private key. This is because the client runs in an environment where the code and storage are accessible to end users, making it vulnerable to extraction or tampering. Typical examples of public clients are single-page applications running in a web browser or mobile apps with no backend service.<br /><br />This version of the profile focuses only on OAuth 2.0 confidential clients, i.e., client applications that can securely store credentials, such as web applications with a backend component. Future versions may specify requirements for public clients if the need arises.

* This profile does not impose specific requirements on end-user authentication at the authorization server. This is a policy matter and is out of scope for this document.

* This profile does not specify process requirements for registering an OAuth 2.0 entity. Such requirements should be defined in supplementary specifications or policies.

* This profile does not define any requirements for using OAuth 2.0 in a federative context, as such requirements are out of scope. For guidance on this topic, refer to the "Ena OAuth 2.0 Federation Interoperability Profile", \[[ENA.Federation](#ena-federation)\].

* OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection, as specified in [RFC7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662), is not covered in this document. However, an entity using this feature may still comply with this profile, provided that none of its requirements are violated.

* OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation, as specified in [RFC7009](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009), is not covered in this document. However, an entity using this feature may still comply with this profile, provided that none of its requirements are violated.

<a name="client_profile"></a>
## 2. Client Profile

<a name="types-of-oauth-clients"></a>
### 2.1. Types of OAuth Clients

Within OAuth 2.0, there are two main types of clients: confidential clients and public clients. Confidential clients can securely store credentials registered with an authorization server, whereas public clients cannot store credentials securely. As pointed out in [1.4](#limitations-and-exclusions), [Limitations and Exclusions](#limitations-and-exclusions), above, this profile applies only to confidential clients. An OAuth 2.0 public client is not compliant with this profile.

Note: This does not mean that mobile apps and JavaScript web applications are disqualified. However, to be regarded as confidential, such applications must securely store credentials, for example, in a backend component.

Since this profile only handles confidential clients, we also distinguish between different subtypes of confidential clients. There are two main subtypes:

* **Client with user delegation** – A confidential client that acts on behalf of a resource owner (user) and requires delegation of the user’s authority to access a protected resource.

* **Machine-to-machine client without user delegation** – A confidential client that makes calls to a protected resource without the involvement of a resource owner (user).

These client subtypes correspond to the implementations of the [Authorization Code Flow](#authorization-code-grant) and [Client Credentials Flow](#client-credentials-grant), respectively.

<a name="client-metadata-and-registration"></a>
### 2.2. Client Metadata and Registration

This profile does not specify how an OAuth 2.0 client is registered with an authorization server or within a federation. This is out of scope for this profile.

However, for interoperability reasons, the requirements stated in the subsections below apply.

<a name="client-identifiers"></a>
#### 2.2.1. Client Identifiers

Every client compliant with the profile MUST be identified by a globally unique URL. This URL MUST use the HTTPS scheme and include a host component. It MUST NOT contain query or fragment components.

\[[RFC6749](#rfc6749)\] and \[[RFC7591](#rfc7591)\] state that a client identifier is simply a unique string. However, since this profile also focuses on the use of OAuth 2.0 across security domains and within federations, the requirements for “Entity Identifiers” as defined in \[[OpenID.Federation](#openid-federation)\] also apply to this profile.

A client registered with multiple authorization servers MUST use the same client identifier (`client_id`) for all registrations. This implies that an authorization server compliant with this profile MUST support clients with client identifiers issued by external parties.

<a name="client-registration-metadata"></a>
#### 2.2.2. Client Registration Metadata

Section 2 of "OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol", \[[RFC7591](#rfc7591)\], lists client metadata claims, and entities compliant with this profile MUST adhere to the requirements in that section, with the extensions and clarifications stated in the subsections below.

Within a pure OAuth 2.0 context, there is no concept of a "client metadata document". The OAuth 2.0 specifications address how a client is registered with an authorization server, and if a client is registered with multiple authorization servers, the registration data may vary between them. Thus, the claims in Section 2 of \[[RFC7591](#rfc7591)\] should be regarded as client registration metadata for a particular registration, rather than as a client metadata document.

> \[[ENA.Federation](#ena-federation)\] specifies requirements for a client producing a metadata document for use within a federation.

<a name="redirect-uris"></a>
##### 2.2.2.1. Redirect URIs

**Metadata claim:** `redirect_uris`

The `redirect_uris` claim is REQUIRED if the client is registered for the `authorization_code` grant type (or any other custom redirect-based flow). If set, at least one URI MUST be provided.

The redirect URIs provided MUST be absolute URIs, as defined in Section 4.3 of \[[RFC3986](#rfc3986)\], to prevent mix-up attacks involving clients. See Section 4.1.1 of \[[RFC9700](#rfc9700)\] for further details.

Redirect URIs MUST be one of the following:

- An HTTPS URL,

- a client-specific URI scheme (provided the requirements for confidential clients apply to a mobile app and that the scheme identifies a protocol that is not for remote access),

- and, for testing purposes, a URI that is hosted on the local domain of the client (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).

If more than one redirect URI is provided, different domains SHOULD NOT be used.

> TODO: Add reference to security chapter where attacks concerning redirects are listed.

<a name="token-endpoint-authentication-method"></a>
##### 2.2.2.2. Token Endpoint Authentication Method

**Metadata claim:** `token_endpoint_auth_method`

The `token_endpoint_auth_method` claim is REQUIRED for the client metadata. It gives the client authentication method for accessing the authorization server token endpoint.

[Section 8.3, Client Authentication](#client-authentication), gives the requirements for how a client authenticates against the authorization server token endpoint. Thus, for clients compliant with this profile the `token_endpoint_auth_method` can be any of the following values:

- `private_key_jwt` - See [8.3.1, Signed JWT for Client Authentication](#signed-jwt-for-client-authentication), below.

- `tls_client_auth` or `self_signed_tls_client_auth` - See [8.3.2, Mutual TLS for Client Authentication](#mutual-tls-for-client-authentication), below.<br /><br />If `tls_client_auth` is used, additional claims according to Section 2.1.2 of \[[RFC8705](#rfc8705)\] MUST be provided.

> A client operating in a federated context may use different methods for different authorization servers. This is out of scope for this profile and is addressed in \[[ENA.Federation](#ena-federation)\].

<a name="token-endpoint-grant-types"></a>
##### 2.2.2.3. Token Endpoint Grant Types

**Metadata claim:** `grant_types`

The `grant_types` claim is an array of grant type strings that the client can use at the token endpoint of an authorization server. The claim is OPTIONAL, and if not present, the `authorization_code` grant type MUST be assumed. 

The client metadata MUST NOT include the `implicit` and `password` grant types among the `grant_types` values. See [Section 5.5, Prohibited Grant Types](#prohibited-grant-types), below.

<a name="json-web-key-set"></a>
##### 2.2.2.4. JSON Web Key Set

**Metadata claim:** `jwks` or `jwks_uri`

The client's JSON Web Key Set \[[RFC7517](#rfc7517)\] document, passed by value or reference (URI).

If the client has registered the `private_key_jwt` token endpoint authentication method, or if the client produces signatures in other circumstances, one, but not both, of the `jwks` and `jwks_uri` claims is REQUIRED.

To facilitate a smooth key rollover, each JWK of the referenced document SHOULD include a `kid` parameter. 

The JWKs provided in the key set MUST adhere to the requirements put in [Section 8.2, Cryptographic Algorithms](#cryptographic-algorithms), below.

<a name="human-readable-client-metadata"></a>
##### 2.2.2.5. Human-readable Client Metadata

Client metadata values intended for human consumption, either directly or via reference (URIs), SHOULD be provided in both English and Swedish using language tags according to BCP 47, \[[RFC5646](#rfc5646)\].

For maximum interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED to also include claim values without language tags. This profile does not specify which language should be used as the default.

Examples:

```
{
  "client_name": "Example client",
  "client_name#sv": "Exampelklienten",
  "client_name#en": "Example client",
  ...
  "policy_uri": "https://www.example.com/policy",
  "policy_uri#sv": "https://www.example.com/policy/sv",
  "policy_uri#sv": "https://www.example.com/policy",
  ...
```  

For further requirements see Section 2.2 of \[[RFC7591](#rfc7591)\].

<a name="connections-to-protected-resources"></a>
### 2.3. Connections to Protected Resources

An OAuth 2.0 client accesses a protected resource by including an access token in its request to the resource server. This section outlines the requirements for how a client compliant with this profile should present an access token in requests to the resource server.

All authorized requests from a client to a resource server MUST be protected by TLS according to [Section 8.1, General Security Requirements](#general-security-requirements), below.

Clients adhering to this profile SHOULD send the access token in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme according to Section 2.1 of \[[RFC6750](#rfc6750)\].

Example:

```
GET /data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3 \
ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWUsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.tyhVfuz \
IxCyGYDlkBA7DfyjrqmSHu6pQ2hoZuFqUSLPNY2N0mpHb3nk5K17HWP_3cYHBw7AhHale5wky6-sVA
```

Clients MAY send the access token in an HTTP request by including it as a form-encoded content parameter named `access_token`, as defined by Section 2.2 of \[[RFC6750](#rfc6750)\].

Clients MUST NOT include the access token as a URI query parameter (Section 2.3 of \[[RFC6750](#rfc6750)\]). The reason is that the access token would be visible in the URL and could be stolen by attackers, for example, from the web browser history. Consequently, a resource server compliant with this profile MUST NOT accept an access token transmitted in a query parameter.

Clients MUST support and be able to process the `WWW-Authenticate` response header field as specified by Section 3 of [[RFC6750](#rfc6750)\].

<a name="connections-to-authorization-servers"></a>
### 2.4. Connections to Authorization Servers

> TODO: Write about AS metadata discovery

> TODO: Refer to grants below for authz and token

<a name="authorization-server-profile"></a>
## 3. Authorization Server Profile

All authorization servers compliant with this profile MUST adhere to the security requirements stated in [Section 8, Security Requirements and Considerations](#security-requirements-and-considerations).

<a name="metadata-and-discovery"></a>
### 3.1. Metadata and Discovery

This section contains requirements on an authorization server's metadata document and how this metadata document is published on a well-known location. 

An authorization server that acts as an OpenID Provider MUST also adhere to Section 5.2, "Discovery Requirements for an OpenID Provider", of \[[OIDC.Sweden.Profile](#oidc-profile)\].

<a name="authorization-server-metadata"></a>
#### 3.1.1. Authorization Server Metadata

An authorization server compliant with this profile MUST produce a metadata JSON document as specified in Section 2 of \[[RFC8414](#rfc8414)\], with the extensions and clarifications stated in the subsections below. 

An authorization server MAY provide signed metadata as specified in Section 2.1 of \[[RFC8414](#rfc8414)\]. In such cases, the authorization server MUST sign the metadata using one of the mandatory signature algorithms listed in [Section 8.2, Cryptographic Algorithms](#cryptographic-algorithms).

> Note: Additional requirements for authorization server metadata may be supplied in other profiles.

<a name="issuer-the-authorization-server-entity-identifier"></a>
##### 3.1.1.1. Issuer - The Authorization Server Entity Identifier

**Metadata claim:** `issuer`

The `issuer` claim is REQUIRED and MUST be a globally unique URL. This URL MUST use the HTTPS scheme and include a host component. It MUST NOT contain query or fragment components.

The authorization server metadata is published at a location derived from its issuer identifier. See [Section 3.1.2, Authorization Server Metadata Publishing](#authorization-server-metadata-publishing), below. This means that if the authorization server is hosted under a path other than the root, the `issuer` value MUST reflect this. For example, `https://as.example.com/service` would be the correct `issuer` value if the authorization server is deployed under the `/service` path at the `as.example.com` host.

<a name="md-authorization-server-endpoints"></a>
##### 3.1.1.2. Authorization Server Endpoints

**Metadata claim:** `authorization_endpoint`

The `authorization_endpoint` claim contains the fully qualified URL of the authorization server’s authorization endpoint, as defined in \[[RFC6749](#rfc6749)\]. This claim is REQUIRED unless the authorization server does not support any grant types that make use of the authorization endpoint.

The authorization endpoint URL MUST NOT include a fragment component, but MAY include a query string.

**Metadata claim:** `token_endpoint`

The `token_endpoint` claim contains the fully qualified URL of the authorization server’s token endpoint, as defined in \[[RFC6749](#rfc6749)\]. This claim is REQUIRED.

The token endpoint URL MUST NOT include a fragment component, but MAY include a query string.

The claims `registration_endpoint`, `revocation_endpoint` and `introspection_endpoint` are OPTIONAL, and their presence depends on whether the authorization server supports the corresponding features.

<a name="as-json-web-key-set"></a>
##### 3.1.1.3. JSON Web Key Set

**Metadata claim:** `jwks_uri`

The `jwks_uri` claim is REQUIRED, and contains an URL to the authorization server's JSON Web Key Set \[[RFC7517](#rfc7517)\] document. This URL MUST use the HTTPS scheme.

The `use` parameter is REQUIRED for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage.

To facilitate a smooth key rollover, each JWK of the referenced document SHOULD include a `kid` parameter. 

The JWKs provided in the key set MUST adhere to the requirements put in [Section 8.2, Cryptographic Algorithms](#cryptographic-algorithms), below.

<a name="as-supported-scopes"></a>
##### 3.1.1.4. Supported Scopes

**Metadata claim:** `scopes_supported`

The `scopes_supported` claim is REQUIRED and it SHOULD list all scopes supported by the authorization server in a JSON array. Authorization servers MAY choose to omit certain scopes that are client-specific or otherwise not intended for general use.

<a name="as-supported-grant-types"></a>
##### 3.1.1.5. Supported Grant Types

**Metadata claim:** `grant_types_supported`

The requirements of this profile are the same as those specified in Section 2 of \[[RFC8414](#rfc8414)\], with the following exception:

If the claim is omitted, the default value SHALL be [ "authorization_code" ].

<a name="supported-endpoint-authentication-methods"></a>
##### 3.1.1.6. Supported Endpoint Authentication Methods

**Metadata claim:** `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`

The `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` claim is REQUIRED and MUST include `private_key_jwt`. It MAY also include `tls_client_auth` or `self_signed_tls_client_auth`, but MUST NOT include any other methods. See [Section 8.3, Client Authentication](#client-authentication), below.

**Metadata claim:** `revocation_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`

The `revocation_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` claim is REQUIRED if the authorization server supports token revocation (i.e., if the `revocation_endpoint` claim is included). If present, the contents of this claim MUST follow the same requirements as the `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` claim (see above).

**Metadata claim:** `introspection_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`

The `introspection_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` claim is REQUIRED if the authorization server supports token introspection (i.e., if the `introspection_endpoint` claim is included). If present, the contents of this claim MUST follow the same requirements as the `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` claim (see above).

<a name="supported-authentication-signing-algorithms-for-endpoints"></a>
##### 3.1.1.7. Supported Authentication Signing Algorithms for Endpoints

**Metadata claim:** `token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported`

The `token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported` claim is REQUIRED, and its contents MUST conform to the signature requirements specified in [Section 8.2, Cryptographic Algorithms](#cryptographic-algorithms).

**Metadata claim:** `revocation_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`

The `revocation_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` is REQUIRED if `revocation_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` is assigned. If present, the contents of this claim MUST follow the same requirements as the `token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported` claim (see above).

**Metadata claim:** `introspection_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`

The `introspection_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` is REQUIRED if `introspection_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` is assigned. If present, the contents of this claim MUST follow the same requirements as the `token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported` claim (see above).

<a name="supported-code-challenge-methods"></a>
##### 3.1.1.8. Supported Code Challenge Methods

**Metadata claim:** `code_challenge_methods_supported`

An authorization server compliant with this profile MUST support the PKCE extension (see [Section 8.4.1, PKCE - Proof Key for Code Exchange](#pkce-proof-key-for-code-exchange). Therefore, the `code_challenge_methods_supported` claim is REQUIRED and MUST include the `S256` challenge method. The `plain` challenge method MUST NOT be supported.

<a name="supported-ui-locales"></a>
##### 3.1.1.9. Supported UI Locales

**Metadata claim:** `ui_locales_supported`

The `ui_locales_supported` claim SHOULD be present and include Swedish (`sv`) and English (`en`).

<a name="authorization-server-metadata-example"></a>
##### 3.1.1.10. Authorization Server Metadata Example

Below is an example of the metadata document for an authorization server:

```json
{
  "issuer": "https://as.example.com/",

  "op_policy_uri": "https://as.example.com/docs/policy",
  "code_challenge_methods_supported": [ "S256" ]  
}
```

> Note: If the authorization server also acts as an OpenID Provider, additional metadata claims will appear in the metadata document.

<a name="authorization-server-metadata-publishing"></a>
#### 3.1.2. Authorization Server Metadata Publishing

Section 3 of \[[RFC8414](#rfc8414)\] states the following:

> "Authorization servers supporting metadata MUST make a JSON document containing metadata as specified in Section 2 available at a path formed by inserting a well-known URI string into the authorization server's issuer identifier between the host component and the path component, if any. By default, the well-known URI string used is `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.".

For an authorization server whose issuer identifier has no path component, for example, `https://as.example.com`, the resulting discovery URL is:

```
https://as.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
```

However, if the authorization server is not deployed at the root but instead under a path such as `/service`, its issuer identifier becomes `https://as.example.com/service`. In this case, according to \[[RFC8414](#rfc8414)\], the discovery URL must be:

```
https://as.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/service
```

This construction may lead to practical deployment challenges, as it requires control over the root path of the host.

Section 4.1 of \[[OpenID.Discovery](#openid-discovery)\] specifies a more pragmatic approach for constructing the discovery URL: the well-known URI suffix is appended to the issuer identifier. Using this method, an authorization server with the issuer https://as.example.com/service would publish its metadata at:

```
https://as.example.com/service/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
```

This approach is more practical but does not fully comply with the requirements in Section 3 of \[[RFC8414](#rfc8414)\]. Therefore, this profile defines the following requirements:

- An authorization server deployed directly under the host root MUST publish its metadata in accordance with Section 3 of \[[RFC8414](#rfc8414)\].

- An authorization server with a path component in its issuer identifier (i.e., not deployed at the root) SHOULD publish its metadata as specified in Section 3 of \[[RFC8414](#rfc8414)\]. If this is not feasible, it MUST publish metadata as described in Section 4.1 of \[[OpenID.Discovery](#openid-discovery)\], using `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` as the well-known URI suffix.

- Consumers of authorization server metadata MUST attempt discovery using all possible locations, as described in Section 5 (“Compatibility Notes”) of \[[RFC8414](#rfc8414)\]. This includes support for legacy URIs such as `/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

<a name="client-registration"></a>
### 3.2. Client Registration

This profile does not specify how a client is registered with the authorization server. Registration may be performed statically, via an out-of-band procedure, through dynamic registration as specified in \[[RFC7591](#rfc7591)\], or by resolving client metadata using OpenID Federation.

An authorization server compliant with this profile MUST ensure that the metadata of a client being registered complies with the requirements stated in [Section 2.2.2, Client Registration Metadata](#client-registration-metadata), and MUST NOT complete the registration if the metadata does not comply.

If a client identifier is assigned by the authorization server at registration time, the identifier MUST comply with the requirements stated in [Section 2.2.1, Client Identifiers](#client-identifiers).

An authorization server compliant with this profile MUST support the registration of a client that already has an assigned client identifier.

<a name="authorization-server-endpoints"></a>
### 3.3. Authorization Server Endpoints

This section outlines the general requirements for the HTTP endpoints exposed by an authorization server compliant with this profile. Specific requirements regarding the messages received on these endpoints are detailed in [Section 5, Grant Types](#grant-types).

<a name="authorization-endpoint"></a>
#### 3.3.1. Authorization Endpoint

Authorization servers compliant with this profile MUST adhere to the requirements from Section 3.1, "Authorization Endpoint", of \[[RFC6749](#rfc6749)\], with the following extensions:

The authorization endpoint MUST be protected by TLS according to [Section 8.1, General Security Requirements](#general-security-requirements).

The authorization server MUST NOT support CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) at the authorization endpoint since the client does not access this endpoint directly.

An authorization server that redirects a request MUST NOT use the 307 HTTP status code. If an HTTP redirection is used (as opposed to JavaScript-based redirection), the authorization server SHOULD use the 303 HTTP status code.

> This requirement exists because, at the authorization endpoint, the authorization server may prompt the user to enter credentials into a form, which is then submitted via a POST request. After verifying the credentials, the authorization server redirects the user agent to the client’s redirect URI. If a 307 status code were used for redirection, the user agent would incorrectly reuse the POST method, potentially sending the user’s credentials directly to the client. See Section 15.4.8 of \[[RFC9110](#rfc9110)\].

See [Section 5.1.1, Authorization Requests](#authorization-requests) for requirements specific to the authorization code grant.

<a name="token-endpoint"></a>
#### 3.3.2. Token Endpoint

Authorization servers compliant with this profile MUST adhere to the requirements from Section 3.2, "Token Endpoint" of \[[RFC6749](#rfc6749)\], with the extension that clients MUST authenticate using one of the methods listed in [Section 8.3, Client Authentication](#client-authentication) when making requests to the token endpoint.

The token endpoint is used by different grant types, and specific requirements for each profiled grant type are listed in [Section 5, Grant Types](#grant-types). The subsections below list the general requirements for token requests and responses.

<a name="token-requests"></a>
##### 3.3.2.1. Token Requests

The following request parameters are REQUIRED for the client to pass to the authorization server’s endpoint, regardless of the grant type being used:

- `grant_type` - The grant type used for the particular request. See [Section 5, Grant Types](#grant-types) for the different grant types specified in this profile.

- `client_id` - The identifier for the client making the request. See [Section 2.2.1, Client Identifiers](#client-identifiers).

Additional request parameters that are specific to each grant type apply and are specified for the respective grant type. See [Section 5, Grant Types](#grant-types).

The authorization server MUST authenticate the client request before proceeding.

Here is an example of an access token request using an authorization code, where `private_key_jwt` is used for client authentication:

```
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: as.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code

```

<a name="token-responses"></a>
##### 3.3.2.2. Token Responses

After the authorization server has successfully processed an access token request, issued an access token, and optionally a refresh token, it creates an HTTP response with status 200 and uses the `application/json` media type.

Entities compliant with this profile MUST adhere to Section 5.1, “Successful Response,” of \[[RFC6749](#rfc6749)\] with the extensions and clarifications listed below.

The following parameter requirements apply for authorization servers compliant with this profile:

- `access_token` - The newly issued access token. This parameter is REQUIRED.

- `token_type` - The type of access token issued. This parameter is REQUIRED. This profile allows the values "Bearer" (see \[[RFC6750](#rfc6750)\]) or "DPoP" (see \[[RFC9449](#rfc9449)\]).

- `expires_in` - The lifetime for the access token in seconds. The parameter is REQUIRED. The value SHOULD be kept as low as practically possible.

- `refresh_token` - A refresh token. This parameter is OPTIONAL.<br /><br />An authorization server compliant with this profile MUST NOT issue a refresh token if no user is involved (for example, the `client_credentials` grant), or if the user does not have a direct relationship with the authorization server (for example, the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer` grant).

- `scope` - The issued scope(s). Section 5.1 of \[[RFC6749](#rfc6749)\] states that the parameter is OPTIONAL if the scopes granted are the same as those requested by the client, and REQUIRED otherwise. This profile states that the inclusion of the parameter is RECOMMENDED, regardless of which scopes were granted.

Example of an access token (in the form of a signed JWT) issued along with a refresh token:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store

{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyMTIzIiwiYXVkIjoiY2xpZW50LmV4YW \

                   012mno345PQR678stu",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 600,
  "refresh_token": "d8p4QwF3a1Lb6Xt9WcG0Zv",
  "scope": "read write"
}
```

<a name="error-responses"></a>
##### 3.3.2.3. Error Responses

Authorization servers compliant with this profile MUST adhere to Section 5.2, “Error Response,” of \[[RFC6749](#rfc6749)\], with the following additions:

It is RECOMMENDED that the `error_description` parameter be included in the error response to provide additional information about the error. The text provided MUST NOT reveal sensitive information, violate user privacy, or expose details that could be useful to an attacker.

Example:

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "error": "invalid_client",
  "error_description": "The client authentication method is not supported"
}
```

<a name="configuration-of-protected-resources"></a>
### 3.4. Configuration of Protected Resources

> TODO: Write about how an authorization server should configure protection of resources. 

<a name="protected-resource-profile"></a>
## 4. Protected Resource Profile

An OAuth 2.0 resource server hosting a protected resource grants access to clients if they present a valid access token with the appropriate scope. The resource server trusts an authorization server to authenticate users and, optionally, obtain their consent before issuing an access token to a client. This section outlines the interoperability and security requirements for OAuth 2.0 protected resources and resource servers.

A resource server compliant with this profile MUST accept access tokens passed in the `Authorization` header as a bearer token, as specified in Section 2.1 of \[[RFC6750](#rfc6750)\], and access tokens passed as form-encoded content parameters, as specified in Section 2.2 of \[[RFC6750](#rfc6750)\].

Resource servers MUST NOT accept access tokens passed in a URI query parameter (Section 2.3 of \[[RFC6750](#rfc6750)\]).

Depending on how a resource server services a request, it MAY also act as an OAuth 2.0 client when it needs to invoke underlying protected resources as part of its processing. This pattern may involve features such as "token exchange", which is not covered in this profile. 

> *TODO: Include pointer to informational reference.*

<a name="validation-of-access-tokens"></a>
### 4.1. Validation of Access Tokens

This profile specifies access tokens only in the form of JWT bearer tokens. This section outlines the requirements for resource servers to validate such access tokens.

Note: This section does not specify any requirements regarding "Token introspection", \[[RFC7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662)\], as it is out of scope for this profile.

Resource servers compliant with this profile MUST validate JWT access tokens as specified in Section 4 of \[[RFC9068](#rfc9068)\], with the following modifications and clarifications:

* An access token that is not signed according to the requirements specified in [Section 6.1](#access-tokens) below, MUST be rejected.

* Reuse of access tokens across multiple authorized requests MAY be allowed, provided the token remains valid and the protected resource does not enforce single-use semantics. Resource servers that require high assurance or non-repudiation may choose to enforce non-reusability of tokens using the `jti` claim as part of a replay detection strategy.<br /><br />If a protected resource does not permit reuse of access tokens, the resource server MUST maintain a cache of previously received JWT IDs (`jti`). If an access token’s `jti` claim is found in the cache and has not expired, the access token MUST be rejected. See Section 4.1.7 of \[[RFC7519](#rfc7519)\] for the definition of the `jti` claim.

    - A resource server deployed across multiple instances MUST share a common replay cache.
    
    - A cached `jti` value is considered expired when the JWT from which it was extracted is no longer valid, based on its `exp` claim.
    
* If a protected resource's access rules are based on scopes, the JWT MUST include the `scope` claim (see Section 2.2.3 of \[[RFC9068](#rfc9068)\]) with an appropriate scope value. Otherwise, the access token MUST be rejected.

<a name="resource-server-error-responses"></a>
### 4.2. Resource Server Error Responses

If a request to the resource server fails or is rejected, the resource server MUST inform the client of the error as specified in Section 3 of \[[RFC6750](#rfc6750)\].

A typical example might look like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="example",
                  error="invalid_token",
                  error_description="The access token has expired"
```

To ensure interoperability, a resource server compliant with this profile SHOULD NOT use any error codes other than those specified in Section 3.1 of \[[RFC6750](#rfc6750)\].

If an access token is rejected due to insufficient scope(s), it is RECOMMENDED to include the scope attribute in the `WWW-Authenticate` header of the error response. This attribute MUST specify the required scope(s) for accessing the protected resource.

Example:

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="example",
                  scope="read write"
                  error="insufficient_scope",
                  error_description="Scopes 'read' or 'write' are required"
```

<a name="protected-resource-identity-and-registration"></a>
### 4.3. Protected Resource Identity and Registration

A protected resource compliant with this profile MUST have a Resource Identifier assigned. This identifier MUST be a URL using the HTTPS schema and including a host component. It SHOULD NOT include a query component, and MUST NOT include a fragment component.

If the protected resource is functioning in a multi-domain, or federative, context, its identifier MUST be globally unique.

A protected resource MAY support publication of its metadata according to "OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata", \[[RFC9728](#rfc9728)\].

It is RECOMMENDED that a protected resource be assigned a resource identifier that corresponds to the URL at which it exposes its service.

Furthermore, if a resource server hosts multiple resources that do not share the same access rules, it is RECOMMENDED that these resources be treated as separate protected resources, and thus be represented with their own resource identifiers.

**Example:**

Assume there are two different servers, server1 and server2, as shown in the illustration below.

![Resource Servers](images/resource-servers.png)

The endpoints on server1 do not share the same access rules and should therefore be treated as two separate protected resources: `https://server1.example.com/api` and `https://server1.example.com/admin`. In contrast, the endpoints exposed by server2 have the same access rules and can therefore be represented by a single protected resource: `https://server2.example.com`.

> Note: In the example below, access rules are illustrated solely through scope requirements. In a real-world scenario, additional rules—such as requiring a specific level of end-user authentication—may also apply.

<a name="cryptographic-algorithms"></a>
### 8.2. Cryptographic Algorithms

This section lists the requirements for cryptographic algorithm support for being compliant with
this profile.

All entities compliant with this profile MUST follow the guidelines in \[[NIST.800-131A.Rev2](#nist800-131)\] regarding use of algorithms and key lengths. Specifically, for signature and encryption keys the following requirements apply:

- RSA public keys MUST be at least 2048 bits in length.
- EC public keys MUST be at least 256 bits in length (signature only). The curve NIST Curve P-256 MUST be supported (\[[RFC5480](#rfc5480)\]), and NIST Curve P-384 and NIST Curve P-521 SHOULD be supported.

Entities conforming to this profile MUST support algorithms according to "JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)", 
\[[RFC7518](#rfc7518)\], with the following additions:

- `RS256`, RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256, is listed as recommended in \[[RFC7518](#rfc7518)\], but is
REQUIRED to support by this profile.

- `RS384`, RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-384, is listed as optional in \[[RFC7518](#rfc7518)\],
but is RECOMMENDED to support by this profile.

- `RS512`, RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512, is listed as optional in \[[RFC7518](#rfc7518)\],
but is RECOMMENDED to support by this profile.

- `ES256`, ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256, is listed as recommended in \[[RFC7518](#rfc7518)\], but
is REQUIRED to support by this profile.

- `ES384`, ECDSA using P-384 and SHA-384, is listed as optional in \[[RFC7518](#rfc7518)\], but is 
RECOMMENDED to support by this profile.

- `ES512`, ECDSA using P-521 and SHA-512, is listed as optional in \[[RFC7518](#rfc7518)\], but is
RECOMMENDED to support by this profile.

Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that an authorization server compliant with this profile supports the following algorithms that are listed as optional in \[[RFC7518](#rfc7518)\]:

- `PS256`, RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256,

- `PS384`, RSASSA-PSS using SHA-384 and MGF1 with SHA-384,

- `PS512`, RSASSA-PSS using SHA-512 and MGF1 with SHA-512.
 

The sender of a secure message MUST NOT use an algorithm that is not set as REQUIRED in \[[RFC7518](#rfc7518)\] or in the listing above, unless it is explicitly declared by the peer in its metadata or registration data.

**Note:** \[[NIST.800-131A.Rev2](#nist800-131)\] contains a listing of algorithms that must not be used. However, there is a need to explicitly point out that the commonly used algorithm SHA-1 for digests is considered broken and MUST NOT be used or accepted.

#### 8.4.1. PKCE - Proof Key for Code Exchange

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is defined in \[[RFC7636](#rfc7636)\]. It t was originally designed to protect native applications from authorization code exfiltration attacks, but it is also used as a countermeasure against "Authorization Code Injection" attacks, see [Section 8.5.1](#injection-of-authorization-code), below.

The use of PKCE with the authorization code grant is REQUIRED by this profile.

A client constructing an authorization request MUST include the `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method` parameters. The `code_challenge_method` MUST be one of the methods listed in the authorization server’s metadata document; see [Section 3.1.1.8, Supported Code Challenge Methods](#supported-code-challenge-methods). The use of the plain method MUST NOT be permitted.

The `code_verifier` MUST be generated by the client according to Section 4.1 of \[[RFC7636](#rfc7636)\], and the `code_challenge` MUST be derived from this value. If the `S256` method is used, the transformation MUST follow Section 4.2 of \[[RFC7636](#rfc7636)\].

The client MUST securely store the `code_verifier`. It MUST NOT be stored in a cookie or in any manner accessible from the user agent.

An authorization server receiving an authorization request that does not include a `code_challenge` parameter MUST reject the request.

An authorization server that successfully processes an authorization request and issues an authorization code MUST associate the corresponding `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method` with the issued code for later verification; see Section 4.4 of \[[RFC7636](#rfc7636)\]. These values MUST be stored securely.

When constructing the access token request, the client MUST include the `code_verifier` parameter containing the previously generated value.

An authorization server receiving a token request where grant_type is `authorization_code` MUST require the presence of the `code_verifier` parameter. If it is missing, the request MUST be rejected.

Finally, an authorization server receiving an access token request MUST verify the supplied `code_verifier` according to Section 4.6 of \[[RFC7636](#rfc7636)\].

<a name="threats-and-countermeasures"></a>
### 8.5. Threats and Countermeasures

Entities compliant with this profile MUST be aware of and implement countermeasures against relevant threats described in "OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice" \[[RFC9700](#rfc9700)\]. This section highlights a selection of those threats that warrant particular attention due to the security requirements defined in this profile. 

<a name="injection-of-authorization-code"></a>
#### 8.5.1. Injection of Authorization Code

Section 4.5 of \[[RFC9700](#rfc9700)\] describes the Authorization Code Injection attack, in which an attacker attempts to inject a stolen authorization code into their own session at the client. The goal is to link the attacker’s session with the legitimate user’s (i.e., the victim’s) resources or identity, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the victim’s data.

The countermeasure against this attack is to always require PKCE. See [Section 8.4.1, PKCE - Proof Key for Code Exchange](#pkce-proof-key-for-code-exchange). This involves using the `code_challenge` parameter in authorization requests and the corresponding `code_verifier` parameter in token requests.

> **Note:** This threat and its countermeasure apply only when the authorization code grant is used.

<a name="requirements-for-interoperability"></a>
## 9. Requirements for Interoperability 

<a name="defining-and-using-scopes"></a>
### 9.1. Defining and Using Scopes

An OAuth 2.0 scope is a mechanism for defining and limiting access to protected resources. It tells the authorization server what level of access the client is requesting, and tells the resource server what access the client has been granted.

In the early days of OAuth 2.0, a typical deployment involved a single authorization server configured to protect a single protected resource. In such cases, when a client requested an access token for a given scope, it was clear to the authorization server which protected resource was being referred to and how to apply its processing logic. Scopes such as `read` and `write` were commonly used and worked well in this context. Their meaning was unambiguous, since the authorization server was configured to protect only one resource.

However, when an authorization server protects multiple resources, how can it determine which resource is being requested based solely on a requested scope?

If generic scopes such as `read` and `write` are used, the authorization server cannot deduce which protected resource the client is requesting access to. To address this limitation, there are two possible solutions:

- Use the `resource` parameter. By using the `resource` parameter as specified in \[[RFC8707](#rfc8707)\], the combination of the indicated protected resource and a (generic) scope provides the authorization server with enough information to process the request and issue an access token.

- Define and use non-generic scopes. By defining scopes that are valid only for a specific use case (e.g., a particular protected resource), the authorization server can determine which resource the client is requesting access to based solely on the requested scope.

It may be tempting to choose the first solution and require that all authorization requests include the `resource` parameter, but there are several issues with this approach that make it less desirable:

- Support for the resource parameter, as defined in \[[RFC8707](#rfc8707)\], is not yet widely implemented in standard software.

- The authorization server metadata claim `scopes_supported` (defined in Section 2 of \[[RFC8414](#rfc8414)\]) loses its usefulness, as there is no information indicating which scope maps to which protected resource. Furthermore, if the authorization server is used in a federated context as described in \[[OpenID.Federation](#openid-federation)\], filtering the authorization server metadata according to policy becomes impossible with respect to the `scopes_supported` claim.

Therefore, this profile specifies the following recommendations and requirements:

An authorization server that either protects multiple protected resources or publishes its metadata in a federation (as defined in \[[OpenID.Federation](#openid-federation)\]) SHOULD use scopes that are unique for a given purpose.

If the authorization server operates within a federation, a defined scope values MUST be unique within that federation.

A scope value MAY be defined to map to a set of protected resources, provided they support the same function and access policy. In such cases, the authorization server MAY accept a `resource` parameter to uniquely identify a specific protected resource, or it may issue an access token with multiple audiences (i.e., valid for all protected resources associated with that scope).

It is RECOMMENDED that scope values follow the format: a URL prefix followed by the access right.

It is RECOMMENDED that scope values unique to a single protected resource be constructed using the resource’s identifier followed by the specific access right.

**Example:**

> Suppose the protected resource identified by `https://server.example.com/api` supports two distinct access rights: read and write. 

> The scopes `https://server.example.com/api/read` and `https://server.example.com/api/write` would then uniquely identify the read and write permissions for that protected resource.

An authorization server MAY choose to map a unique scope to a different scope value when including scopes in an access token. This can be useful, for example, when the protected resource is a legacy system with hardcoded scope definitions. Referring to the example above, if a client requests the `https://server.example.com/api/read` scope, the resulting JWT access token could instead contain the scope `read`.

However, if the protected resource implements “OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata”, \[[RFC9728](#rfc9728)\], scope mapping in the authorization server SHOULD NOT be performed. In such cases, the `scopes_supported` claim in the protected resource metadata would not align with the actual scopes used by clients, leading to inconsistency and potential interoperability issues.
